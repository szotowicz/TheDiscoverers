>The second independent project in C#, over which de facto is still working. After the previous production adopted mainly among my family and friends, I decided to write applications that allows you to play up to 4 players. "The Discoverers" is a computer simulation of the board game. The choice we have 3 maps: Poland, Europe, World - this choice affects the kind of questions received.

>An important advantage is the ability to play several players, educational application page and sound effects gameplay. The game aimed for a younger audience.
